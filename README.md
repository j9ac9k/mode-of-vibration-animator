# Truss Structure Natural Frequency Vibration Viewer

This is a haskell file that will take in structure information; such as truss connectivity information, cross sectional area, elastic modulus and fixture points and in turn animate the various modes of vibration.

This project is largely a learning exercise for me to learn Haskell.
